# Guess_The_Number
In this We will guess the number and it will tell us if the number is high or less and we can successfully guess the numbers it will give us in how many attempts the number was Guessed.
There Are Certain rules to write the code:
Create a class Game, which allows a user to play "Guess the Number" game once.
Game should have the following methods:
      1. Constructor to generate the random number
      2. takeUserInput to take a user input of number
      3. isCorrectNumber() to detect whether the number entered by the user is true
      4. getter and setter for noOfGuesses
   Use properties such as noOfGuesses(int), etc to get this task done.
